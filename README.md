# Specification for Demographic Dataset Validation
- Project Title: 	Demographic (DM) dataset Validation
- Description: 		 Generate DM (SDTM) dataset as per CDISC standard by using raw DM & Comvar 
dataset. Validate it with primary demographic dataset by writing independent code 
in SAS.
- SAS Version:		SAS onDemand for Academics
## Introduction 
The project involves validating an already developed Demographic dataset using the input SDTM datasets and comparing both.
- Structure of DM: One record per subject.

## Logical Follow.
Logical flow: Data selection:
- Call initial.sas to set up directory structure.
- Sort Comvar dataset by using USUBJID and Merge the DM dataset with 
Comvar and take requisites Variables as per specs.
- Finally sort it by USUBJID.

## Inputs
     - dm.sas7bdat
     - Comvar.sas7bdat

|SN|Variable Name 	|Variable Label |Data Type|CDISC Notes 	|Algorithm|
|---|---------------|---------------|---------|---------------|---------|
|1|STUDYID| Study Identifier| Char| Unique identifier for a study.| Direct Mapping|
|2|DOMAIN |Domain Abbreviation|Char |Two-character abbreviation for the domain.| "DM"|
|3|USUBJID| Unique Subject Identifier |Char|Identifier used to uniquely identify a subject across all studies for all applications or submissions involving the product. This must be a unique number, and could be a compound identifier formed by concatenating STUDYID-SITEID-SUBJID.|Direct Mapping(DM.STUDYID concatenated '-'concatenated SITEID concatenated'-'concatenated DM.SUBJID)|
|4|SUBJID| Subject Identifier for the Study|Char|Subject identifier, which must be unique within the study. Often the ID of the subject as recorded on a CRF.|Direct Mapping|
|5|RFSDTC| Subject Reference Start Date/Time|Char|Reference Start Date/time for the subject in ISO 8601 character format. Usually equivalent to date/time when subject was first exposed to study treatment. Required for all randomized subjects; will be null for all subjects who did not meet the milestone the date requires, such as screen failures or unassigned subjects.|Direct Mapping Comvar._RFSDTC|
|6|RFENDTC| Subject Reference End Date/Time|Char|Reference End Date/time for the subject in ISO 8601 character format. Usually equivalent to the date/time when subject was determined to have ended the trial, and often equivalent to date/time of last exposure to study treatment. Required for all randomized subjects; null for screen failures or unassigned subjects. |Direct Mapping Comvar._RFENDTC|
|7|SITEID| Study Site Identifier| Char| Unique identifier for a site within a study.| Direct Mapping|
|8|INVNAM| Investigator Name| Char| Name of the investigator for a site.| Direct Mapping Comvar.invnam|
|9|BRTHDTC| Date/Time of Birth | Char| Date/time of birth of the subject. | Direct Mapping|
|10|AGE| Age | Num| Age expressed in AGEU. May be derived from RFSTDTC and BRTHDTC, but BRTHDTC may not be available in all cases (due to subject privacy concerns). | floor((_rfstdt -input(brthdtc,yymmdd10.))/365.25)|
|11|AGEU |Age Unit| Char|Units associated with AGE.|"YEAR"|
|12|SEX| Sex|Char|Sex of the subject.|Direct Mapping|
|13|RACE| Race|Char|Race of the subject.|Direct Mapping|
|14|ARMCD| Planned Arm Code |Char|ARMCD is limited to 20 characters and does not have special character restrictions. The maximum length of ARMCD is longer than for other â€•shortâ€– variables to accommodate the kind of values that are likely to be needed for crossover trials. For example, if ARMCD values for a seven-period crossover were constructed using two-character abbreviations for each treatment and separating hyphens, the length of ARMCD values would be 20.|Direct Mapping comvar._AMCD|
|15|ARM| Description of Planned Arm| Char|Name of the Arm to which the subject was assigned.|Direct Mapping comvar._AMCD.|
|16|COUNTRY|Country| Char| Country of the investigational site in which the subject participated in the trial.|Direct Mapping|
|17|DMDTC|Date/Time of Collection| Char| Date/time of demographic data collection.|Direct Mapping|
|18|DMDY| Study Day of Collection |Num|Study day of collection measured as integer days.|(input(dovdtc,yymmdd10.) - _rfstdt)+1|
